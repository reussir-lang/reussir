//! Type lowering: ground Reussir types → MLIR types.
//!
//! Scalars map directly to builtin MLIR types. A record has no `DefTable` here,
//! so it resolves through a layout table ([`TypeCtx`]) keyed by its `(def, args)`
//! identity — the ground layout `mono` baked into the MIR.
//!
//! Three record flavours lower, selected by the instance's declared capability:
//! * a **`[value]`** record is an inline aggregate — an identified
//!   `!reussir.record<…>` held directly by value;
//! * a **`[shared]`** record is heap-allocated and reference-counted — the same
//!   identified record type wrapped in a `!reussir.rc<…>` pointer. A shared
//!   record that appears as a field of another record is therefore stored as an
//!   `rc` link, which falls out of lowering its field type here.
//! * a **`[regional]`** record is also a boxed `rc` pointer, but region-allocated;
//!   the box capability is read from the value's flexivity coloring — `flex`
//!   while it is region-local and mutable, `rigid` once it has been frozen out of
//!   its region.
//!
//! Both struct (`compound`) and enum (`variant`) records lower this way. An enum
//! is an identified `!reussir.record<variant …>` whose members are the per-case
//! payload compounds (`{enum}::{case}`); the variant carries a tag plus a payload
//! area sized to the largest case. This module also holds the numeric
//! classification [`expr`](super::expr) uses to choose the right cast op.
