//! The runtime's C-ABI symbol table, for embedding the runtime into an
//! in-process JIT.
//!
//! A JIT that links this crate (rather than loading the runtime shared library
//! from disk) can register these `(name, address)` pairs directly with its
//! execution session, so JIT'd code resolves its `__reussir_*` calls against the
//! linked-in runtime. Referencing the function items through
//! [`exported_symbols`] also keeps them from being dead-stripped out of a
//! statically linked binary that never calls them from Rust.
